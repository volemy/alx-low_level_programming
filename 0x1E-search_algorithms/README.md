# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Resources
Search algorithm
Space complexity (1)

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What is a search algorithm?
What is a linear search?
What is a binary search?
What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs?

# Requirements
## General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
Compiler: gcc on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All files should end with a new line.
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
Your code should use the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
Global variables are not allowed.
No more than 5 functions per file.
Only the printf function of the standard library is allowed. Calls to other functions like strdup, malloc, etc., are forbidden.
The prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file search_algos.h.
Donâ€™t forget to push your header file.
All header files should be include guarded.

# Big O Notation
You will be asked to write files containing Big O notations. Please use this format:

O(1)
O(n)
O(n!)
n*m -> O(nm)
n square -> O(n^2)
sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
log(n) -> O(log(n))
n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
...
